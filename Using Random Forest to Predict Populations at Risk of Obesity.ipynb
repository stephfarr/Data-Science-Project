    "It is well documented that obesity can lead to serious health conditions (NHS, 2017) and costs the NHS around £6.5 billion per year (DHSC, 2023). Lord Darzi’s (Darzi, 2024) independent review of the NHS emphasised the need for Integrated Care Boards (ICB) to shift from reactive hospital care to preventative community care. In line with this, Bury Locality, as part of Greater Manchester Integrated Care Partnership, has established a major conditions board (‘Bury Integrated Care Partnership Locality Plan Refreshed for 2025/2026’, no date) to identify key issues, risks and gaps. \n",

Such models could enable the Locality to target preventative interventions more effectively – ultimately improving health outcomes and achieving greater financial efficiency. "

    "To test this approach, publicly available data from a study on obesity (Koklu, N., & Sulak, S.A., 2024) has been sought, via Kaggle, to develop a proof of concept. Whilst the dataset is not UK-based, it provides an opportunity to assess the feasibility of RF in identifying at-risk populations. The insights gained from this analysis will inform the potential application of similar models using local data.\n",

    "RF has been chosen due to it’s ability to handle mixed data types, non-linear relationships, imbalanced data, correlated variables and has shown to have better predictive performance than other classification models (Breiman, 2001). Feature importance is also a factor in RF that is useful to decision makers in resource targeting decisions."
